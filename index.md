**Mathilde's recipes** is a project created that combines cooking and coding.

### Cooking objectives
1. Cook healthy & delicious meals on a regular basis
2. Figure out what groceries to get more efficiently
3. Figure out how much time each meal takes to prepare
4. Being able to check my recipes from anywhere 
 
### Coding objectives
I plan to learn programming on my spare time & I wish to write some programs that I could directly use from the Github page
1. Convert units (*e.g.* Celsius to Fahrenheit)
2. Select recipes with defined filters (*e.g.* preparation time) 
3. Generate grocery list based on future recipes
