# Method:

2. In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients **For the meatballs**.
3. With your hands, a couple of spoons or an ice cream scoop, make the meatballs and place them on a plate.
4. In a pan large enough so that the meatballs don't touch each other, heat the canola oil.
5. When the pan is hot, add the meatballs one by one.
6. With tongs, turn the meatballs to pan sear them.

*It is important not to poke the meatballs as they might fall apart and lose their juice.*

7. Boil water in a sauce pan and insert the 2 tomatoes for about a minute.
8. Peel the skin off the tomatoes and remove the juice/seeds.
9. Cut the tomatoes in small pieces
10. Add the tomato sauce, tomato pieces and about 175 mL water into the pan where the meatballs are cooking.

12. Cover the pan and let it simmer for another 30 minutes rotating the meatballs from time to time.
13. Enjoy!

## Comments
1. I used dried herbs, but would probably be more tasty with fresh herbs.
2. It worked great with premade tomato sauce from a jar.
3. This dish can be prepared in advance and reheated in the microwave when needed.
